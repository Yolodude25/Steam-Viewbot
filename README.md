# Steam Viewbot
a viewbot that was nabbed because i could, and valve didnt care or respond to their security email and didnt want to fix it.

## Why are you releasing this?
i didn't want to do this but since valve didn't patch it and im leaving the cs community regardless, here i am feeding nors3 and his fanbase and his 10 girlfriends the clout he wants :D

here is the sauce code to the steam viewbot that i nabbed as well so suck it felix.

shoutout to the insiders who were feeding nors3 as well hope you suck a fat one. fuck valve, fuck cs, fuck ido, fuck nors3 and cheaters keep on cheating, hestianet isn't running anymore so don't worry about it.

if you wanna keep your trustfactor high don't commendbot yourself with brand new accounts, use a hwid changer that intercepts requests to spoof the hwid data instead of a shitty one, make sure you don't go obvious as fuck, raging in any form especially wallbanging a lot = insta VACNet, spinning is detected and results in an autoban.

## How does it work?
This viewbot works by spamming a steam broadcast URL with requests from proxies, there are other methods so figure them out yourself, i reported every single possible method (as there's more than this) but valve don't care about anything that could affect their game, all they care about is people lying on twitter, gj ido


## How do I use it?

1) Enable Steam Broadcasting from the Steam Overlay (Settings -> Broadcasting)

2) Either use index.js or old.js depending on the proxy location (if the proxy is located online on a website then use index.js otherwise download all the proxies and import them into proxies.json and use old.js, or just implement it yourself cuz no one cares and im not here to help, im here to feed the mf clout that nors3 wants), replace the "const target" value inside whichever file you are using with your SteamID64 which you are streaming from. You can even use another account that has steam community permissions enabled, for that simply enable broadcasting on that other account, join your friends GOTV stream (either the cl_join_advertise 2 method for official matchmaking or use a GOTV IP) and start streaming from the GOTV connection.

3) Profit??? (Watch as the proxies requests go through and your viewers will show up on the scoreboard, may take some time tho)


hope you had fun being obsessed with me nors3, the interviews can suck it all as if i give a heck about anything when i literally said im done with cs. keep wasting your time on me man, and remember to munch on them doritos.

Also, if you used this at all and you can then please donate to [@RyanAtRBM](https://twitter.com/RyanAtRBM/) charity of choice [Movember](https://us.movember.com/donate)
